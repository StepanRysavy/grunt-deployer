FlashTalking with Polite Load template
======================================

This template helps you to create a FlashTalking banner, including the polite load. After setting up width and height in *package.json*, your basefile and richload will be autogenerated. The test enviromnent enables FT in Richload, but upon deployment disables it again. After completing, the build generates both Base and Richload, and names them accordingly to the folder, where your project is.  

run: *npm install*  
set up width and height in the *package.json*  
create your banner  
test with *grunt*  
deploy with *grunt deploy*  

While in development, you can utilize less sourcemaps and speedy build: nothing gets minified or uglyfied, thus saving time. This happens only after you call *grunt deploy*  

Your JS files should me in *js/modules*, all vendor files in *js/lib*. A concat will make them a single file.
Start with main.less (even though you don't use any LESS features). Reset is already there. CSS files will be prepended to the final CSS. You can add fonts into subfolders, they will be copied without any edit.

ZIP, Base and Richload folder don't get uploaded to GIT  

The basic HTML file looks like this:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
		<title></title>
		<link type="text/css" href="css/main.css" rel="stylesheet" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- For testing only -{{test}}->
		<script src="http://cdn.flashtalking.com/frameworks/js/api/{{api}}/html5API.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">var myFT = new FT;</script>
	    <!-- Default -->
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/app.js"></script>
	</body>
